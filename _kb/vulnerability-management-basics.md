**Intro**  
Vulnerability management is the ongoing work of finding, judging, fixing, and watching software and systems so attackers can’t use known weak spots. It is guided by the basic security idea called the **CIA triad** — Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability — which tells us what to protect and why.

<!--more-->

## 1) Core idea

- **Vulnerability** — a weakness an attacker can use (like an unlocked door).
- **Exploit** — a technique or tool used to take advantage of that weakness.
- **Threat** — the person or group who wants to use the exploit.
- **Vulnerability Management (VM)** — a loop: *discover → assess → prioritize → fix → verify → monitor*.

Why it matters: Many breaches start from a known vulnerability that wasn’t fixed. Good VM reduces this risk and helps keep services available and data safe.

## 2) CVE — what it is and why it matters

- **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)** is a public ID for a known vulnerability so everyone can talk about the same issue. Example: a popular library bug gets a CVE entry that tools and teams can track.
- **Who runs CVE data:** MITRE issues CVE IDs; the NVD (National Vulnerability Database) adds more info like CVSS and CPE.

---

## 3) CVSS — a score for technical severity

- **CVSS** gives a number (0.0–10.0) that describes how serious a problem is from a technical view. It uses fields like Attack Vector, Attack Complexity, Privileges Required, User Interaction, Scope, and the CIA impacts.
- **Tip:** CVSS is technical severity — *not* a full business decision. Context matters.

---

## 4) CPE — how tools match products to CVEs

- **CPE** (Common Platform Enumeration) is a standard naming format that lets tools match a CVE to a product and version (so you know whether *your* install is affected).  
  Example format:

```
cpe:2.3:a:vendor:product:version:update:edition:*:*:*:*:*
```

---

## 5) EPSS — the chance a CVE will be used in the wild

- **EPSS** (Exploit Prediction Scoring System) gives a probability that a vulnerability will be exploited in real attacks. It complements CVSS by adding *likelihood* to *severity*. Use both when deciding urgency.

---

## 6) Put CVSS + EPSS + Context together (quick rule)

1. Check **CVSS** for technical severity.  
2. Check **EPSS** for how likely exploitation is.  
3. Add **business context**: Is the system public-facing or critical? Is the component actually used in production?

**Tiny example (trimmed JSON):**

```json
[
  {
    "VulnerabilityID": "CVE-2022-12345",
    "PkgName": "openssl",
    "InstalledVersion": "1.1.1g",
    "FixedVersion": "1.1.1n",
    "Severity": "HIGH",
    "CVSS": {"V3Score": 9.8},
    "EPSS": 0.91
  },
  {
    "VulnerabilityID": "CVE-2021-56789",
    "PkgName": "libxml2",
    "InstalledVersion": "2.9.4",
    "FixedVersion": "2.9.12",
    "Severity": "CRITICAL",
    "CVSS": {"V3Score": 9.8},
    "EPSS": 0.02
  }
]
```

From this we patch **OpenSSL** first (high EPSS), and schedule **libxml2** (low EPSS and maybe low exposure) after risk review.

---

## 7) Basic lifecycle checklist

- Keep an **asset inventory**. You can’t protect what you don’t know.
- Keep **CVE feeds** and **EPSS data** updated.
- **Prioritize** by exposure + business impact, not by score alone.
- **Verify fixes** by re-scan and testing.
- **Monitor** and repeat.

---

## 8) Summary

Vulnerability management uses data (CVE/CPE/CVSS/EPSS), tools, and business judgment. Treat **CVSS** as technical severity, **EPSS** as exploitation chance, and always layer in **context** about your assets.
