## Intro

OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) categories describe common web-application security risks. They are high–level names (what can go wrong).  
A **CWE** (Common Weakness Enumeration) describes a specific *type of coding or design weakness* (why it goes wrong).  
A **CVE** (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) is a *real, published instance* of a vulnerability (a concrete case).  

So: **OWASP category → maps to CWEs → when found in products, they may be published as CVEs.**

---

## 1. Broken Access Control
**Meaning:** Users can do things they shouldn’t — access other users’ data, perform admin actions, or change permissions.  
**Typical CWEs:** CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), CWE-285 (Improper Authorization)  
**Example:** Changing `/user/1234/orders` to `/user/1235/orders` shows another user’s data.  

---

## 2. Cryptographic Failures (Sensitive Data Exposure)
**Meaning:** Weak or missing encryption, poor key handling, or storing secrets in plain text.  
**Typical CWEs:** CWE-310 (Cryptographic Issues), CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information), CWE-327 (Use of Broken Crypto Algorithm)  
**Example:** Passwords stored in plain text or sending tokens over HTTP.  

---

## 3. Injection (SQL, OS commands, LDAP, etc.)
**Meaning:** Untrusted input is interpreted as code.  
**Typical CWEs:** CWE-89 (SQL Injection), CWE-78 (OS Command Injection), CWE-94 (Code Injection)  
**Example:** `"... WHERE id = " + userInput` with input `1; DROP TABLE users;`.  

---

## 4. Insecure Design
**Meaning:** Unsafe architecture or missing threat models.  
**Typical CWEs:** Covers broad issues across controls and system flows.  
**Example:** API exposes admin functions without extra authentication.  

---

## 5. Security Misconfiguration
**Meaning:** Default settings, open endpoints, or unnecessary features enabled.  
**Typical CWEs:** CWE-16 (Configuration), CWE-1192 (Incorrect Permission Assignment)  
**Example:** Public S3 bucket or admin console with default password.  

---

## 6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components
**Meaning:** Using libraries/frameworks with known vulnerabilities.  
**Typical CWEs:** Varies; common ones include CWE-119 (Buffer Errors), CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)  
**Example:** Old framework version with a remote-code-exec bug.  

---

## 7. Identification & Authentication Failures
**Meaning:** Weak login, session flaws, or credential issues.  
**Typical CWEs:** CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), CWE-384 (Session Fixation)  
**Example:** Password reset link that can be guessed.  

---

## 8. Software and Data Integrity Failures
**Meaning:** Trusting code/data that may be tampered with.  
**Typical CWEs:** CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data), CWE-494 (Download Without Integrity Check)  
**Example:** Insecure deserialization leading to remote code execution.  

---

## 9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
**Meaning:** Lack of logging/alerts leads to late or missed breach detection.  
**Typical CWEs:** CWE-778 (Insufficient Logging), CWE-203 (Info Exposure Through Discrepancy)  
**Example:** No logs of privileged actions, attackers move unseen.  

---

## 10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) & Similar Flaws
**Meaning:** Server is tricked into making attacker-chosen requests.  
**Typical CWEs:** CWE-918 (SSRF), CWE-611 (XXE for XML-based SSRF)  
**Example:** App fetches attacker’s URL and hits internal cloud metadata service.

## How OWASP, CWE, and CVE Connect

- **OWASP:** Category name, good for non-technical communication.  
- **CWE:** Technical weakness type, useful for engineering fixes.  
- **CVE:** Real-world case, useful for tracking patches and advisories.  

**Flow:**  
OWASP (Injection) → CWE-89 (SQLi) → CVE-2021-44228 (a specific SQLi in a product).  

---

## Quick Mapping Cheat-Sheet

- **Injection** → CWE-89 (SQLi), CWE-78 (OS cmd), CWE-94 (Code inj).  
- **XSS** → CWE-79.  
- **Broken Auth** → CWE-287, CWE-384.  
- **Broken Access Control** → CWE-284/CWE-285.  
- **Insecure Deserialization** → CWE-502.  
- **SSRF** → CWE-918.  
- **Unrestricted File Upload** → CWE-434.  
- **Sensitive Data Exposure** → CWE-312/CWE-327.  
- **Vulnerable Component** → tracked mainly by CVEs.  

---

## Practical Use

- **For scans/reports:** tag findings by OWASP (business view) and CWE (engineering fix).  
- **For patching:** check if CVE exists for the component/version.  
- **For communication:** OWASP terms simplify risk reporting to managers.  
- **For technical triage:** CWE and CVE give detail for developers.

## Final Word

OWASP Top categories highlight *what kinds of risks matter most*. CWEs explain the *root causes*, and CVEs capture the *real-world instances*. Linking all three helps teams not only find problems, but also prioritize and fix them effectively.
