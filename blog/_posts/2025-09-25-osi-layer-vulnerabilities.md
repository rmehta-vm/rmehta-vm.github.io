# Understanding Vulnerabilities Through the OSI Layers

Most computer science students learn the **OSI model** — the seven layers that describe how data travels across networks. What’s often missing is how **cybersecurity vulnerabilities** show up at each of these layers.  

By looking at vulnerabilities through the OSI lens, you can connect textbook knowledge with real-world security risks. Let’s walk the layers from bottom to top.

---

## Layer 1 — Physical Layer

**What it does:** The wires, Wi-Fi signals, and physical media that carry bits.  

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Cable tapping (attackers physically intercepting signals).  
- Hardware implants (malicious chips added to routers or USB drives).  
- Jamming wireless signals to cause denial of service.

**Example:**  
An attacker places a **hardware keylogger** between a keyboard and PC, capturing every keystroke.

## Layer 2 — Data Link Layer

**What it does:** Provides reliable node-to-node transfer. Think Ethernet, ARP, MAC addresses.  

**Vulnerabilities:**
- **MAC spoofing:** attacker pretends to be another device on LAN.  
- **ARP spoofing/poisoning:** sends fake ARP messages to redirect traffic.  
- VLAN hopping in misconfigured switches.

**Example:**  
In a corporate LAN, an attacker uses ARP spoofing to trick machines into sending traffic through their device — enabling a **man-in-the-middle** attack.

## Layer 3 — Network Layer

**What it does:** Routing, IP addresses, packet forwarding.  

**Vulnerabilities:**
- **IP spoofing:** fake IP source to bypass filters.  
- **ICMP flooding (Smurf attack):** overwhelm a network with ICMP packets.  
- Route injection in BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) — misrouting global traffic.

**Example:**  
A **DDoS attack** that floods a server with spoofed IP packets, making it unreachable.

## Layer 4 — Transport Layer

**What it does:** Ensures end-to-end communication (TCP, UDP).  

**Vulnerabilities:**
- **TCP SYN flood:** attacker sends many half-open connections to exhaust server resources.  
- UDP amplification attacks (using DNS, NTP, etc.).  
- Exploiting weak session handling.

**Example:**  
Attackers send millions of SYN packets to a web server. The server allocates resources for each — until it crashes (**SYN flood DoS**).

---

## Layer 5 — Session Layer

**What it does:** Manages sessions between applications (setup, maintain, terminate).  

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Session hijacking (stealing a valid session token).  
- Replay attacks (reusing captured session data).  

**Example:**  
If a web app doesn’t use secure cookies, an attacker can steal the **session ID** and impersonate a user.

---

## Layer 6 — Presentation Layer

**What it does:** Translates, encrypts, compresses data.  

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Weak encryption algorithms (MD5, SHA-1).  
- Improper input parsing leading to exploits (e.g., image parsing bugs).  
- TLS/SSL misconfigurations.

**Example:**  
A system still using **SSLv2** encryption allows attackers to decrypt sensitive communications using downgrade attacks.

---

## Layer 7 — Application Layer

**What it does:** Interfaces with end users and applications (HTTP, DNS, SMTP, etc.).  

**Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL injection, XSS, CSRF.  
- Authentication bypass.  
- Insecure APIs.  
- Malware-laden file uploads.

**Example:**  
A web app vulnerable to **SQL Injection** (`' OR '1'='1`) gives attackers access to the entire database.

## Why This OSI View Helps

- **For learners:** Relating vulnerabilities to the OSI model ties new concepts to familiar ground.  
- **For professionals:** Thinking layer-by-layer helps ensure security controls are **defense in depth** — not just at the top application layer.  
- **For organizations:** Mapping incidents to OSI layers improves root cause analysis and guides where to add monitoring.

## Final Thoughts

The OSI model is more than a theory exercise. Every layer has unique **attack surfaces**. Security teams need to consider them all:

- Protect the **bottom** layers (hardware, network) with segmentation, monitoring, and physical controls.  
- Secure the **top** layers (apps, APIs, sessions) with input validation, encryption, and secure coding.  

When combined, you create a **layered defense** that mirrors the OSI model itself — a full-stack approach to cybersecurity.
