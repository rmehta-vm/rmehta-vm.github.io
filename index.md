Cybersecurity today is a race between defenders and attackers. Every piece of software and infrastructure you rely on—from operating systems to cloud workloads to third-party libraries—can become a doorway for risk if not properly managed. That’s where **Vulnerability Management (VM)** comes in.

This knowledge base is designed to give you a clear, practical understanding of VM:  
- **Foundations**: Learn what CVEs are, how the CIA triad guides security, and how to read CPEs, CVSS scores, and EPSS predictions.  
- **Scanning Approaches**: Explore host-based agents, network scans, SBOM analysis, and static code checks—plus how combining them reduces blind spots.  
- **Prioritization & Fixes**: Discover how to turn scan results into real protection by focusing on exploitability, exposure, and business impact.  
- **Advanced Topics**: See how VM fits into cloud workloads, containers, and Kubernetes; how standards like PCI or HIPAA tie in; and how to integrate AI/ML to cut false positives.  
- **Future Trends**: Contextual package analysis, LLM-augmented SCA, continuous threat exposure management, and more.  

Think of this as your **guided path** from basics to advanced practice. Whether you’re a student, a security engineer, or a leader building strategy, you’ll find material that explains **what matters, why it matters, and how to act**.
