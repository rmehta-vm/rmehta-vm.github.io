Hi, I’m **Raj Mehta**. I build practical **vulnerability management** programs that cut noise, add context, and help teams fix fast.

**Focus Areas**
- VM, SCA/SAST, SBOM, CTEM/EASM
- CIEM/SSPM, Cloud & Kubernetes security
- LLM-assisted triage & fixes, product strategy

Start here: **[Knowledge Base](/kb/)**.
